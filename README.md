# Adicionador de Extens√µes
I created this python file to rename several photos with no proper extension.

I was checking some folders and then I found dozens, maybe more than a hundred pictures with no extension. When I renamed some of them to include .jpg or .jpeg, I could finally see the photo. It would take a while to rename all of them manually so I decided to create this python file to do the job for me, practicing with what I have learned.
